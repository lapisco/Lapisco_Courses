- [`v000_SCIG_SC_SENSORV_HOS.csv`](v000_SCIG_SC_SENSORV_HOS.csv)

- [`v000_SCIG_SC_SENSORV_SCM.csv`](v000_SCIG_SC_SENSORV_SCM.csv)


The naming convetion follows the rule:

- `v000`: version of the database (concerns only to author).
- `SCIG`: electrical machine is a Squirrel-Cage Induction Generator (SCIG).
- `SC`: The inserted fault is short-circuit (SC)
- `SENSORC`: The sensor used to monitor the machine. 
- `FOURIER`: The feature extracted method used to build the dataset.

The experimental setting is based on [Reboucas *et al*, 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045790618307584) diagram's. More detais are exhibited in this paper.
